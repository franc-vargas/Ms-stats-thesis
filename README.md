# Introduction

This repo contains the scripts to my Masters thesis, included in the folder 2_scripts, as well as the index.qmd file to compile it.
The 0_A to 0_C scripts include the way I calculated the distance matrix, although due to size restritions, some files could not be uploaded, so if someone's doing this from scratch, then you'll likely have to re-calculate it. 
I mostly did it due to RAM limitations of my laptop.

# Regarding original excel / csv files

Most, if not all data used, is stored as a .rds file so there should be no need for the original excel files, but if you someone wants / needs the original ones, I can provide them.
