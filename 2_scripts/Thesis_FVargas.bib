	abstract = {Parasitic salmon lice are potentially harmful to salmonid hosts and farm produced lice pose a threat to wild salmonids. To control salmon lice infections in Norwegian salmonid farming, numbers of lice are regularly counted and lice abundance is reported from all salmonid farms every month. We have developed a stochastic space-time model where monthly lice abundance is modelled simultaneously for all farms. The set of farms is regarded as a network where the degree of contact between farms depends on their seaway distance. The expected lice abundance at each farm is modelled as a function of i) lice abundance in previous months at the same farm, ii) at neighbourhood farms, and iii) other, unspecified sources. In addition, the model includes explanatory variables such as seawater temperature and farm-numbers of fish. The model gives insight into factors that affect salmon lice abundance and contributing sources of infection. New findings in this study were that 66\% of the expected salmon lice abundance was attributed to infection within farms, 28\% was attributed to infection from neighbourhood farms and 6\% to non-specified sources of infection. Furthermore, we present the relative risk of infection between neighbourhood farms as a function of seaway distance, which can be viewed as a between farm transmission kernel for salmon lice. The present modelling framework lays the foundation for development of future scenario simulation tools for examining the spread and abundance of salmon lice on farmed salmonids under different control regimes.},

More effective population management and conservation strategies can result from multivariable assessments of factors associated with spatial dynamics of parasite spillover. Objective Our study characterised spatial patterns of sea lice (Lepeophtheirus salmonis, Caligus clemensi) infection on out-migrating chum (Oncorhynchus keta) and pink (O. gorbuscha) salmon in an area with Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) farming. Methods A multivariable statistical model for sea louse parasitism of out-migrating chum and pink salmon was developed from 166,316 wild salmon sampled in the Broughton Archipelago, British Columbia, Canada from 2003 to 2012. We assessed for factors hypothesized to influence sea lice infection levels, at the non-motile life stage, including spatial scales of infection sources. Results Fish length, sampling year and method were strong explanatory factors. Infection was greatest in higher salinity water. Farmed and wild juvenile salmon infection levels were correlated, on average, within 30 km. Except for 2004, sea lice infection on farms were typically well below the regulatory level (3 motiles per fish). Average intensity of non-motile infections observed on the wild fish were 6.36 (SD = 9.98) in 2004 compared to 1.66 (SD = 1.25) for the other years. Conclusions Accuracy of future model estimates will benefit by including hydrodynamic data accounting for anisotropic spread of sea lice from sources. Multivariable statistical modelling over long time series data strengthens understanding of factors impacting wild juvenile salmon infection levels and informs spatial patterns of aquatic epidemiology.},

	abstract = {Sea lice are ectoparasites of salmonids, and are considered to be one of the main threats to Atlantic salmon farming. Sea lice infestation on a farm is usually initiated by attachment of the free-living copepodid stage derived from the surrounding water, frequently originating from adult lice on the same farm or from neighboring salmonid farms, referred to as internal and external sources, respectively. Various approaches have been proposed to quantify sea lice infestation pressure on farms to improve the management of this pest. Here, we review and compare five of these methods based on sea lice data from 20 farms located near Grand Manan island in the Bay of Fundy, New Brunswick, Canada. Internal and external infestation pressures (IIP and EIP, respectively) were estimated using different approaches, and their effects were modeled either by a unique parameter for all production cycles or by different parameters for each production cycle, using a multivariate state-space model. Predictive variables, such as water temperature and sea lice treatments, were included in the model, and their effects across production cycles were estimated along with those of other model parameters. Results showed that models with only EIP explained the variation in the data better than models with only IIP, and that models with unique IIP and unique EIP for all cycles were generally associated with the best model fit. The simplest, fixed lag method for calculating infestation pressure had the best predictive performance in our models among the methods studied.},

We follow complete production cycles for a sample of farms between 2009 and 2015. We estimate a simultaneous salmon biomass growth and Caligus abundance model. The statistical analysis determines the effect of antiparasitic treatments, location of farms, environmental conditions and Caligus abundance on the salmon growth profile. Using outside cost information, we simulate how unit production costs vary by treatment and farm characteristics. Our results suggest that unit production costs increase on average by \$1.4 US/kg with Caligus and treatments. Treatment costs are compensated by higher harvesting levels, and unit production costs are invariant to the situation without treatment. All estimated effects differ depending on farm’s environmental and spatial conditions, suggesting that the design of cost-effective intervention calls for discriminatory regulation under heterogeneous conditions.},

	abstract = {Sea lice (Caligus rogercresseyi) are external parasites that affect farmed salmonids in Chile, and the scale of their sanitary and economic impact cannot be overstated. Even though space–time patterns suppose parasite aggregation, specific locations related to different infestation levels, as well as their associated factors across the geographic range involved, had not been investigated as of the writing of the present article. The understanding of the effects and factors entailed by the presence of C. rogercresseyi may be deemed a key element of Integrated Pest Management (IPM). In the present study, the multivariate spatial scan statistic was used to identify geographic areas and times of C. rogercresseyi infestation and to estimate the factors associated with such patterns. We used official C. rogercresseyi monitoring data at the farm level, with a set of 13 covariates, to provide adjustment within the analyses. The analyses were carried out for a period of 5 years (2012–2016), and they included three fish species (Salmo salar, Oncorhynchus mykiss, and Oncorhynchus kisutch) in order to assess the consistency of the identified clusters. A retrospective multinomial, spatial, and temporal scan test was implemented to identify farm clusters of either of the different categories of C. rogercresseyi infested farms: baseline, medium, and high, based on the control chemical threshold established by the health authority. The baseline represents adequate farm performance against C. rogercresseyi infestation. Then, production and environmental factors of the medium and high infestation farms were compared with the baseline using regression techniques. The results revealed a total of 26 clusters (p {\textless} 0.001), of which 12 correspond to baseline, 1 to medium, and the remaining 13 to high infestation clusters. In general, baseline clusters are detected in a latitudinal gradient on estuarine areas, with increasing relative risks to complex island water systems. There is a spatial structure in specific sites, north of Los Lagos Region and central Aysén Region, with high infestation clusters and epidemic peaks during 2013. In addition, average weight, salmon species, chemotherapeutants, latitude, temperature, salinity, and year category are factors associated with these C. rogercresseyi patterns. Recommendations for an IPM plan are provided, along with a discussion that considers the involvement of stock density thresholds by salmon species and the spatial structure of the efficacy of chemical control, both intended to avoid the advance of resistance and to minimize environmental residues.},

Coho salmon O. kisutch and Atlantic salmon Salmo salar are more resistant to this parasite. Among the native fish species associated with netpen aquaculture, E. maclovinus harbours 4 caligid copepods, namely Lepeophtheirus mugiloidis, C. flexispina, C. teres and C. cheilodactylus (in the same order of ranked abundance). Odonthestes regia only harbours C. flexispina, whereas Paralichthys microps is a host of Lepeophtheirus edwardsi and C. flexispina. It is highly likely that the transfer of C. flexispina to salmonids is mediated by the presence of these native fish species.},

The fecundity of C. rogercresseyi females collected from native hosts (Eleginops maclovinus) captured near salmon farms in southern Chile was measured to evaluate the reproductive output of this parasite on this host fish. From June 2008 to May 2009, 212 specimens of E. maclovinus were examined. Each fish was measured, and all its parasites were collected, sorted and counted. Seventy-nine ovigerous C. rogercresseyi females (OFs) were measured. Total body length, egg string length and total number of eggs per string were recorded for each parasite. Ovigerous females body length varied between 3.9 and 5.0 mm. Fecundity varied between 12 and 56 eggs string−1, and it was correlated with OF body length. Temporal variations in OF fecundity were explained by co-variation in OF body length, but not by month. Ovigerous females on E. maclovinus were smaller and showed lower fecundity than OFs on farmed salmon. Our results suggest that native hosts play a secondary role in C. rogercresseyi egg production in Codigue bay.},

Although several species have been recognised to have the potential to affect growth, fecundity, and survival of their hosts, it has only been with the development of semi-intensive and intensive aquaculture that their importance as disease-causing agents has become evident (Johnson et al., 2004). Members of the family Caligidae, referred to as sea lice, are the most commonly reported species on fish reared in brackish and marine waters. Sea lice have a significant economic impact due to reduced growth performance resulting from the presence of the sea lice and/or the residues of chemical treatments, as well as from the costs of the treatments themselves (Sinnott, 1999; Rae, 2002; Johnson et al., 2004). Indirect and direct losses due to sea lice in salmonid aquaculture globally are estimated to be around €300 million annually (Costello, 2009). However, until now the economic impact in other marine non-salmonid culture has not been reported.},

	abstract = {There are now many examples where ecological researchers used non-Euclidean distance metrics in geostatistical models that were designed for Euclidean distance, such as those used for kriging. This can lead to problems where predictions have negative variance estimates. Technically, this occurs because the spatial covariance matrix, which depends on the geostatistical models, is not guaranteed to be positive definite when non-Euclidean distance metrics are used. These are not permissible models, and should be avoided. I give a quick review of kriging and illustrate the problem with several simulated examples, including locations on a circle, locations on a linear dichotomous network (such as might be used for streams), and locations on a linear trail or road network. I re-examine the linear network distance models from Ladle, Avgar, Wheatley, and Boyce (, Methods in Ecology and Evolution, 8, 329) and show that they are not guaranteed to have a positive definite covariance matrix. I introduce the reduced-rank method, also called a predictive-process model, for creating valid spatial covariance matrices with non-Euclidean distance metrics. It has an additional advantage of fast computation for large datasets. I re-analysed the data of Ladle et al. (, Methods in Ecology and Evolution, 8, 329), showing that fitted models that used linear network distance in geostatistical models, both with and without a nugget effect, had negative variances, poor predictive performance compared with reduced-rank methods, and had improper coverage for the prediction intervals. The reduced-rank approach using linear network distances provided a class of permissible models that had better predictive performance and proper coverage for the prediction intervals, and could be combined with Euclidean distance models to provide the best overall predictive performance.},

	abstract = {Sea lice are marine parasites affecting salmon farms, and are considered one of the most costly pests of the salmon aquaculture industry. Infestations of sea lice on farms significantly increase opportunities for the parasite to spread in the surrounding ecosystem, making control of this pest a challenging issue for salmon producers. The complexity of controlling sea lice on salmon farms requires frequent monitoring of the abundance of different sea lice stages over time. Industry-based data sets of counts of lice are amenable to multivariate time-series data analyses. In this study, two sets of multivariate autoregressive state-space models were applied to Chilean sea lice data from six Atlantic salmon production cycles on five isolated farms (at least 20 km seaway distance away from other known active farms), to evaluate the utility of these models for predicting sea lice abundance over time on farms. The models were constructed with different parameter configurations, and the analysis demonstrated large heterogeneity between production cycles for the autoregressive parameter, the effects of chemotherapeutant bath treatments, and the process-error variance. A model allowing for different parameters across production cycles had the best fit and the smallest overall prediction errors. However, pooling information across cycles for the drift and observation error parameters did not substantially affect model performance, thus reducing the number of necessary parameters in the model. Bath treatments had strong but variable effects for reducing sea lice burdens, and these effects were stronger for adult lice than juvenile lice. Our multivariate state-space models were able to handle different sea lice stages and provide predictions for sea lice abundance with reasonable accuracy up to five weeks out.},

	abstract = {In many scientific disciplines, straight line, Euclidean distances may not accurately describe proximity relationships among spatial data. However, non-Euclidean distance measures must be used with caution in geostatistical applications. A simple example is provided to demonstrate there are no guarantees that existing covariance and variogram functions remain valid (i.e. positive definite or conditionally negative definite) when used with a non-Euclidean distance measure. There are certain distance measures that when used with existing covariance and variogram functions remain valid, an issue that is explored. The concept of isometric embedding is introduced and linked to the concepts of positive and conditionally negative definiteness to demonstrate classes of valid norm dependent isotropic covariance and variogram functions, results many of which have yet to appear in the mainstream geostatistical literature or application. These classes of functions extend the well known classes by adding a parameter to define the distance norm. In practice, this distance parameter can be set a priori to represent, for example, the Euclidean distance, or kept as a parameter to allow the data to choose the metric. A simulated application of the latter is provided for demonstration. Simulation results are also presented comparing kriged predictions based on Euclidean distance to those based on using a water metric.},

	abstract = {Natural ecological communities are continuously buffeted by a varying environment, often making it difficult to measure the stability of communities using concepts requiring the existence of an equilibrium point. Instead of an equilibrium point, the equilibrial state of communities subject to environmental stochasticity is a stationary distribution, which is characterized by means, variances, and other statistical moments. Here, we derive three properties of stochastic multispecies communities that measure different characteristics associated with community stability. These properties can be estimated from multispecies time-series data using first-order multivariate autoregressive (MAR(1)) models. We demonstrate how to estimate the parameters of MAR(1) models and obtain confidence intervals for both parameters and the measures of stability. We also address the problem of estimation when there is observation (measurement) error. To illustrate these methods, we compare the stability of the planktonic communities in three lakes in which nutrient loading and planktivorous fish abundance were experimentally manipulated. MAR(1) models and the statistical methods we present can be used to identify dynamically important interactions between species and to test hypotheses about stability and other dynamical properties of naturally varying ecological communities. Thus, they can be used to integrate theoretical and empirical studies of community dynamics.},

	abstract = {Caligus rogercresseyi, [Contrib. Zool. 69 (2000) 137] is the only caligid known to affect the salmon industry in Southern Chile. Economic losses due to reduced fish quality, cost of chemical treatment and outbreaks of other diseases such as the Piscirickettsiosis occur. The life cycle of C. rogercresseyi is described in rainbow trout reared in seawater tanks from observations made under natural conditions of light and temperature between January 1997 and April 1998. Fish were infected with laboratory-cultured larvae obtained from ovigerous females. Rainbow trout were periodically slaughtered for parasite collection and identification. C. rogercresseyi life cycle includes the following stages: two nauplius, one copepodid, four chalimus and the adult. No preadult stage was observed. Timing of the different stages of development was directly dependent on water temperature. The maturation of the eggs or the time for a complete life cycle took place at 45 days in July at 10.3 °C, 31–32 days in April at 12.4 and 12.8 °C, respectively, and at 26 days in November at 15.2 °C. In January, at 16.7 °C, only the appearance of first eggs were observed at 18 days. A simple degree–day (dd) model is proposed for each developmental stage between 4 and 17 °C, where the development rate is a linear function of the average temperature of water. Using this degree–day model, the proportion of fourth stage chalimus was maximum at 172 dd of effective temperature, adult males at 193 degree–days, adult females at 208 dd. The minimum temperature threshold is at 4.2 °C where there is no development of the parasite. The appearance of first eggs occurred at 231 dd and the first pigmented eggs at 277 dd. The temperature-independent degree–days value allowed to predict the timing of C. rogercresseyi life cycle at any temperature within the evaluated range.},

The relationship between salmon farming and sea lice is made up of various components: the parasite, host, environment and farming practices, which make it difficult to identify patterns in parasite population dynamics to define prevention and control strategies. The objectives of this study were to analyse and compare the effect of farming, sanitary practices and environmental variables on the abundance of gravid females (GF) and juveniles (JUV) of C. rogercresseyi on Salmo salar in three Salmon Neighborhood Areas (SNAs) in Region 10, south of Chile. Linear mixed-effects models of the negative binomial distribution were used to evaluate the effect of the different explanatory variables on GF and JUV. Productive variables were the key drivers explaining the abundance of GF and JUV. Results suggest that C. rogercresseyi is not controlled and JUV are persistent in the three SNAs, and sanitary practices do not control the dissemination of the parasite among sites. Environmental variables had a low impact on sea lice abundance. There is a need to perform analysis for modelling of parasite population dynamics to improve Integrated Pest Management, including changes in the governance to achieve an effective prevention and control.},

This study shows that the number of females was higher than the number of males after the application of an anti-sea lice treatment, with the lowest sex ratio (1.2:1) for emamectin benzoate and the highest sex ratio (14.9:1) for azamethiphos. There were no significant differences in the proportion of females after an anti-sea lice treatment for the different products (p = 0.609) and the same for males (p = 0.864).

Sensitivity towards azamethiphos was lower in the farms from Region X than in those in Region XI. Yet azamethiphos treatment efficacy for adult lice was above 90\% in all farms and the re-infestation rate low. Previous use of other organophosphates in Region X was suggested as the possible cause for the difference in sensitivity between regions. Low sensitivity towards deltamethrin coupled with low deltamethrin and cypermethrin treatment efficacies, high number of treatments and high re-infestation rate was detected in mid-west of Region X, indicating a severe resistance problem. In addition, this area probably had high lice infestation pressure since high number of treatments with the still effective azamethiphos was needed to keep the lice abundance low. In other areas, those parameters indicated that the resistance level and the infestation pressure were lower, but with differences between farms. Sensitivity towards emamectin benzoate was low and similar in the four farms (no treatment efficacy data available). Differences in sensitivity between louse genders were explored. Females tended to be less sensitive than males to azamethiphos only at low louse sensitivity. Females were more resistant than males to deltamethrin, although the differences decreased when sensitivity was low. Males tended to be less susceptible than females to emamectin benzoate when sensitivity decreased. The combination of methods and data presented in this study proved to be useful for detecting resistance issues and problematic areas regarding lice infestation. They may also be used for anticipating problems in the future, which is crucial for improving the use of anti-louse chemicals and reducing the risk of resistance development.

This introduction was due to the loss of sensitivity of lice to EMB after 7years of exclusive use. A detailed field appraisal of treatments was carried out on salmon farms at two sites near Puerto Montt (Lat 42ºS) in August 2007 to evaluate the efficacy of hydrogen peroxide in the control of C. rogercresseyi. A skirt was used on one farm for treatments and an enclosed tarpaulin in the other. Hydrogen peroxide was applied by bath at a concentration of 1.5gl−1 for 20min treatment but this did not kill C. rogercresseyi. Most of the parasites recovered from the treatment and were available to infest new hosts. Treatments were carried out in tanks under laboratory conditions to test the findings obtained in the field and these gave similar results. Caligus recovered completely after 30min post treatment.},

	abstract = {The economic cost of salmon louse (Lepeophtheirus salmonis and Caligus rogercresseyi) infestations in the Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) industry has been estimated to be around \$900 million annually. This high cost has driven a concerted effort to develop, examine, understand, and implement various methods for louse control. Husbandry interventions utilising warm water exposure have been highly successful in complementing traditional chemotherapeutants, especially as the efficiency of the latter has reduced in recent years. In this study, we sought to examine the impact of thermal delousing on gill health in two commercial sites with different historical husbandry and treatment interventions prior to and post-thermal treatment. Methods to characterise gill health and the response to thermal treatment included a detailed examination of the gill for microparasites using both histology and qPCR and targeted immune gene expression analysis, most notably antigen-presenting cells (mhc ii), proinflammatory cytokines (il-1β and tnf-α) and inhibitory cytokines (tgf-β and il-10). Furthermore, we examined the bacterial communities present on the gill surface using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. Data obtained from these trials indicated a minimal impact on gill microparasite prevalence in response to the thermal treatment. The expression of immune markers exhibited a significant decrease across both sites after treatment. Intriguingly, marked differences in the gill bacterial communities in response to treatment between the two sites were clearly observed. This divergence could be attributed to the notable differences in husbandry history and health status of the fish at the two sites prior to the thermal treatment. Our data suggest that microbiome diversity is an informative indicator of fish gill health and could be used to define appropriate interventions when treating sea lice.},

	abstract = {The present paper describes the growth properties of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) post-smolts reared at 6, 10, 14 and 18 °C for 12 weeks following transfer to seawater. Growth rate, feed intake, feed conversion efficiency (FCE), and stomach evacuation rate were significantly influenced by temperature and fish size. Highest growth rate was seen in the 14 °C group (1.53\% d−1), no differences in growth were seen between the 10 and 18 °C groups (1.35\% d−1, 1.29\% d−1), and lowest growth observed at 6 °C (0.78\% d−1) group. Optimal temperature for growth (ToptG) increased with fish size, whereas optimal temperature for feed conversion efficiency (ToptFCE) decreased as fish size increased. The results suggest an optimum temperature for growth of 12.8 °C for 70–150 g to 14.0 °C for 150–300 g post-smolts. Optimum temperature for FCE dropped from 13.4 °C to 11.0 °C for the same size classes. A wide parabolic regression curve between growth, feed conversion efficiency and temperature indicates high temperature tolerance of Atlantic salmon in this size range studied. Highest stomach evacuation rate was seen in the 18 °C group, where the proportion of meal remaining in the stomach decreased from 100 to less than 5\% after 24 h of starvation. No differences in stomach evacuation rate were recorded between the 10 and 14 °C groups, whereas a significant delay in stomach evacuation was seen in the 6 °C group. Overall, these findings may have important consequences for optimization of commercial production of Atlantic salmon post-smolts.},

In this study, the effects of temperature, DO, and their interaction on the growth, antioxidant status, digestive enzyme activity, serum biochemical parameters, and liver IGF-1 expression in rainbow trout were evaluated. Fish (initial weight, 109.98 ± 3.28 g) were reared in a recirculating system for 4 weeks and subjected to 6 treatments at three temperatures (13 °C, 17 °C, and 21 °C) and two DO contents (4.2 mg L−1 and 9.6 mg L−1). Physiological parameters were determined at the end of the trial. Specific growth rate and feed consumption were the highest at 17 °C and the lowest at 21 °C. Additionally, lysozyme, trypsin, lipase, and amylase activities, serum glucose and serum triglyceride contents, and IGF-1 expression decreased significantly at 21 °C and total serum protein and albumin contents were significantly higher at 21 °C than at 13 °C and 17 °C, indicating that high temperature impaired the immunity, digestion, and growth of rainbow trout. However, the adverse effects of high temperature can be alleviated by a high DO content, as evidenced by the smaller increments and decrements of these parameters under hyperoxic conditions than under hypoxic conditions. In response to high temperature stress, an increase in antioxidant enzyme activity led to the removal of oxygen free radicals under hyperoxic conditions; however, this increase was inhibited under hypoxia. Our results indicated that high temperatures have adverse effects on rainbow trout, and these harmful effects can be reduced by a high DO content.},

	abstract = {Developing sustainable aquaculture remains a challenge, notably finding suitable alternatives to marine ingredients in carnivorous fish diets such as rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) in changing climate. These new diets are especially important because rainbow trout are an ecologically and economically significant aquaculture species. Therefore, we investigated the impact of sustainable ingredients and water temperature manipulations on rainbow trout growth characteristics and mitochondrial function. A total of 432 fish were fed four isocaloric, isolipidic, and isonitrogenous diets comprised 40 \% crude protein and 20 \% lipid and formulated as diet 1 (animal-based protein +25 \% fish oil/ 50 \% plant oil/ 25 \% terrestrial animal oil), or diet 2 (animal-based protein +100 \% plant oil), or diet 3 (plant-based protein +25 \% fish oil/ 50 \% plant oil/25 \% terrestrial animal oil), or diet 4 (plant-based protein +100 \% plant oil) at 14 °C or 18 °C or 20 °C water temperature. Results showed percent weigh gain (PWG) and specific growth rate (SGR), feed efficiency (FE), and feed intake (FI) were significantly (P {\textless} 0.05) higher in fish reared at 14 °C and 18 °C compared to 20 °C. The PWG, FE, FI, and SGR levels were significantly (P {\textless} 0.05) higher for fish fed diets 1 and 2 than those fed diets 3 and 4. Dietary composition influenced whole-body proximate composition, while temperature affected protein, moisture, and lipid contents. For protein, lipid, and energy contents, temperature-diet interactions were significant (P {\textless} 0.05). There were differences in mitochondrial enzymatic activities in muscle, liver and intestine. Diet affected only complex V activity in the liver, whereas temperature significantly (P {\textless} 0.05) affected the activities of complexes II, III, and V. A temperature-dietary interaction was observed for complex V. The temperature regimens, but not dietary composition, affected muscle mitochondrial enzymatic activities. There were significant (P {\textless} 0.05) effects of temperature on complex III, IV, and citrate synthase activities in the intestine, whereas dietary composition had no significant impact (P {\textgreater} 0.05). Based on diet, temperature, and diet-temperature interactions effects, selected genes were expressed differently in different tissues. The nd1, cox2, cytb, cox1, atp6 and PPAR-α genes were significantly influenced by diet and temperature interactions in muscle, liver and intestine. Overall, our results showed that both temperature and dietary composition had significant effects on growth characteristics, proximate composition, mitochondrial enzymatic activities, and their interactions on gene expression levels in rainbow trout. These findings underscore the importance of considering these factors in the development of plant-based aquafeeds in order to optimize growth and productivity.},

	abstract = {In many modern applications of geostatistics in the earth sciences, the empirical information is abundant and with complete spatial coverage (e.g. satellite sensor images). In these cases, a critical characteristic of spatial variability is the continuity of the random field that better models the natural phenomenon of interest. Such continuity describes the smoothness of the process at very short distances and is related to the behaviour of the semivariogram near the origin. For this reason, a semivariogram model that is flexible enough to describe the spatial continuity is very convenient for applications. A model that provides such flexibility is the Matern model that controls continuity with a shape parameter. The shape parameter must be larger than zero; a value larger than 1 implies a random field that is m-times mean square differentiable if the shape parameter is larger than m. A package of computer programs is provided for performing the different steps of a geostatistical study using the Matern model and the performance and implementation are illustrated by an example.},

	abstract = {Understanding spatial statistics requires tools from applied and mathematical statistics, linear model theory, regression, time series, and stochastic processes. It also requires a mindset that focuses on the unique characteristics of spatial data and the development of specialized analytical tools designed explicitly for spatial data analysis. Statistical Methods for Spatial Data Analysis answers the demand for a text that incorporates all of these factors by presenting a balanced exposition that explores both the theoretical foundations of the field of spatial statistics as well as practical methods for the analysis of spatial data. This book is a comprehensive and illustrative treatment of basic statistical theory and methods for spatial data analysis, employing a model-based and frequentist approach that emphasizes the spatial domain. It introduces essential tools and approaches including: measures of autocorrelation and their role in data analysis; the background and theoretical framework supporting random fields; the analysis of mapped spatial point patterns; estimation and modeling of the covariance function and semivariogram; a comprehensive treatment of spatial analysis in the spectral domain; and spatial prediction and kriging. The volume also delivers a thorough analysis of spatial regression, providing a detailed development of linear models with uncorrelated errors, linear models with spatially-correlated errors and generalized linear mixed models for spatial data. It succinctly discusses Bayesian hierarchical models and concludes with reviews on simulating random fields,  non-stationary covariance, and spatio-temporal processes.Additional material on the CRC Press website supplements the content of this book. The site provides data sets used as examples in the text, software code that can be used to implement many of the principal methods described and illustrated, and updates to the text itself.},

They recognize its merits in providing unbiased estimates with minimum variance. Several statistical packages now have the facilities they require, as do some geographic information systems. In the latter kriging is an option for interpolation that can be done at the press of a few buttons. Unfortunately, the ease conferred by this allows one to krige without understanding and to produce unreliable and even misleading results. Crucial for sound kriging is a plausible function for the spatial covariances or, more widely, of the variogram. The variogram must be estimated reliably and then modelled with valid mathematical functions. This requires an understanding of the assumptions in the underlying theory of random processes on which geostatistics is based. Here we guide readers through computing the sample variogram and modelling it by weighted least-squares fitting. We explain how to choose the most suitable functions by a combination of graphics and statistical diagnostics. Ordinary kriging follows straightforwardly from the model, but small changes in the model function and its parameters can affect the kriging error variances. When kriging is automated these effects remain unknown. We explain the choices to be made when kriging, i.e. whether the support is at points or over blocks, and whether the predictions are global or within moving windows.},

	abstract = {Modeling of the variogram is a critical step for most geostatistical methods. However, most of the prevalent variogram-based solutions are designed without sufficient consideration of the effect of the interpolation process on their application. This paper proposes an automated variogram modeling framework, which simultaneously considers the fit of the experimental variogram and interpolation accuracy in the modeling variogram interpolation result. The variogram modeling framework can be treated as a nonlinear optimization problem with two sub-goals. The first is to optimize the goodness of fit between the experimental and theoretical variogram values under the conditions of their designated parameters. Second, we seek to optimize the difference between measured values and the associated kriging estimates with the candidate variogram model. A typical case study was chosen using a public dataset to test the proposed method, which was implemented using a genetic algorithm, and its performance was compared with the ones of other commonly applied variogram modeling approaches. As expected, the traditional variogram modeling method that only considers fitting standard experimental variograms showed severe sensitivity to errors in data and parameters; classical cross-validation modeling results tended to overlook the experimental variograms. By contrast, the proposed method succeeded in producing variogram models with robust, high-quality kriging estimates and favorable fitness of experimental variograms in a more powerful and flexible way.},

	abstract = {Chilean Patagonia is one of the most extended fjord regions in the world that covers nearly 240,000km2 with an extremely complex coastline and topography in one of the least densely populated areas of the country (1–8 inhabitants every 10km2). In recent years, the area has been undergoing somewhat intense pressure since several commercial projects in hydroelectricity, tourism, and commercial salmon and mytilid cultures have been developed, or are in progress. Concomitantly, several large research programs have been devised to study the physical, chemical, and biological environment of Patagonia, such as the CIMAR FIORDO, and recently COPAS Sur-Austral based at Universidad de Concepcion, that attempts to close the bridge between oceanographic knowledge and its use by society. In this introductory article we summarize the collection of papers comprising this Special Issue of Continental Shelf Research. These papers deal with aspects of regional oceanography and geology, inorganic and organic geochemistry, ecology of pelagic and benthic organisms, and past changes in productivity.},

	abstract = {Measurements of velocity and density profiles were made to describe the transverse structure of the flow in Aysen Fjord, Southern Chile (45.2°S and 73.3°W). Current profiles were made with a 307.2kHz acoustic doppler current profiler (ADCP) during 20 repetitions of a cross-fjord transect during one semidiurnal tidal cycle. The transect had a ∼320° orientation, 3km length, and its bathymetry consisted of two channels, one on the southern side (230m depth) and the other on the northern side (180m depth), separated by a bank ca. 65m depth, which was located ∼1km from the northern coast. Density measurements to a maximum depth of 50m were made at the extremes of each transect repetition and over the bank. Also, a total of nine CTD stations that covered the surroundings of the bank was sampled 2 days prior to the ADCP sampling. During the sampling period the mean flow showed a three layer structure that was consistent with up-fjord wind-induced exchange: a thin ({\textless}8m) weak outflow close to the surface due to river discharge; a layer of inflow (down-wind) underneath attributed to the effect of wind-stress; and a deep compensatory outflow due to the barotropic pressure gradient set up by the wind. The bank caused the strongest wind-induced net inflows and outflows to be shifted to the channels and also disrupted the three-layer structure. Also, the strongest tidal current amplitudes were located over the bank. The near-surface flow and density distributions suggested that the transverse dynamics were ageostrophic in a layer above ∼50m. This was indicated by the wind-induced shifting of the location of salt water intrusion from the northern side to the southern side of the fjord. Density measurements also suggested an alternation to quasigeostrophic conditions in this upper layer during calm winds. Below this layer the dynamics remained quasigeostrophic.},
